Hi there, Iâ€™m Crystal Scott.

As a Web Accessibility Engineer with a deep understanding of web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in creating and managing digital solutions that adhere to the highest standards of accessibility. With expertise in WCAG guidelines, development best practices, UI/UX Design, along with extensive knowledge in WAI-ARIA, I am adept at guiding projects towards full WCAG conformance and best practices, enhancing usability for all users.

I am an IAAP (CPWA) Certified Professional in Web Accessibility and a Trusted Tester certified by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Accessible Systems and Technology. My passion for technology is rooted in its potential to create inclusive and accessible digital environments. My commitment to lifelong learning is further evidenced by my ownership and management of the Accessibility Book Club on LinkedIn.

In my role in digital software project management, I've led multiple engineering teams, focusing on building accessible software and websites. This experience honed my skills in project coordination and strategy. A key achievement was leading the development of an online accessible eLearning platform and an internal Auditing Report tool as Product Manager. I managed both from start to finish, showcasing my capability in guiding the full product lifecycle. These projects stand out as benchmarks in accessible digital learning and reporting, embodying web accessibility best practices.

As a versatile developer with a flair for design, I am a proficient design annotation ninja, bringing a wealth of experience in Figma to create detailed and user-centric design guidance through annotations. My expertise extends to content management, where I've developed on a variety of platforms including WordPress, Webflow, Shopify, and Squarespace. This diverse experience is complemented by my strong foundation in custom building with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, along with CSS frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap. My adaptability and broad skill set enable me to excel across multiple platforms, making me a well-rounded developer capable of tackling a wide range of digital projects.
