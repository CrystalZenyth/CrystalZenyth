Hi there, I’m Crystal Scott.

As a Frontend Master and Accessibility Expert, I have a passion for creating inclusive and accessible web experiences. With strong HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, I strive to build custom websites that not only look great but also meet the highest accessibility standards. I have extensive knowledge of WCAG and WAI-ARIA, accessibility best practices, web auditing, web remediation, and Webflow skills.

In addition to my technical expertise, I also specialize in Web Design Annotations in Adobe XD and Figma. This skillset enables me to work closely with designers, developers, and clients to ensure that designs are not only visually stunning but also functional, accessible, and meet the clients' requirements.

I was educated in coding by The Last Mile and Code the Dream Bootcamp, where I honed my technical skills and learned the importance of creating accessible websites. In fact, I am an expert in the accessibility field because I hold a Web Accessibility Specialist certification from IAAP. Currently, I am working on building out an e-learning platform, a web auditing report tracking system, and maintaining many other websites.

Through my work, I strive to make the web a more inclusive and accessible place for everyone. Whether it’s designing and developing websites, educating others on accessibility best practices, or advocating for accessibility, I am dedicated to making a positive impact on the web.
